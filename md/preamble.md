My great-grandfather, a general and a World War II hero, was imprisoned, disenfranchised, and killed simply because he was of the wrong political party; my grandfather never had the chance to go to college because his social origin was “impure” and not proletarian; my grandmother, a middle-schooler, was almost killed in a massacre between the workers and the “subversives” during the Cultural Revolution; my parents were part of the protests that ended in the Tiananmen Square Massacre. It would be no wonder that I wish to learn the stories of the victims, victims of civil unrest, of genocides, of war, and of power.

> The easiest way... is to… build your own innocence on your status as victim.

These victims often suffered immensely. People often assume plentiful innocence and virtue in the victims as a result of their sufferings. As with many overgeneralizations about diverse groups, this assumption only hides the truth about victims. The complexity of the real world often deviates from the ideal extremes, and many became victims because of their own wrongful actions or desires. They, sometimes, can even cause others to suffer and become their fellow victims.

A notable example of this was the Dutch Tulip Mania, during which people speculated on the ever-rising demand for tulip bulbs and heavily invested in it. When the tulip bubble popped, many lost their life savings and endangered Dutch economy.

In his *Flora's Malle-wagen* (circa 1640), Hendrik Pot demonstrated the speculative nature of the tulip trade and suggested that the reason for the investors' sufferings were because of their own greed and immorality. His painting shows the flower goddess Flora riding a carnival cart with her followers. He commentated on the mania through his careful choice of subjects. Among her followers were three men wearing fool's caps and two mistresses. Pot sought to use these different followers to redicule and characterize the mania. These characters are Lie-all, who tells lies signifying deceit, Tospot, who drinks incessantly representing gluteny, Wealthcliffe and Mistress Take-it-in, weighing gold and symbolizing greed, and Mistress Vain Hope, whoes Bird of Hope had just escaped her. Right behind them on the road followed weavers from Haarlem with their equipment for production trampled under their feet. Through these subjects Pot sought to show that the mania was detrimental to society's moral and economic wellbeing.

Pot placed the subjects associated with flowers and indecent desires in the middle of the frame, obstucting the landscape, fracturing it into two uneven parts. On the left is the St. Bavo's Cathedral in Haarlem while on the right the sea is wailing. Howling wind inflates the sail to its fullest, heading towards the sea as did the cart in the distance. The careful placement of the landscape and the landscape suggests a departure from the morals and from God in pursuit of false idols and satisfaction of sins. God punishes these sinners who strayed from virtue by aiding them to their eventual demise in the sea with strong wind. 

Pot criticized the blind speculation of the Tulip Mania through his painting, and aslo presented an unfamiliar image of victims: one of self-victimization and suffering as a consequence of one's own actions.

Some victims, however, perfectly fit into the assumption of innocence and virtue. Some fought for the lives of others, while some were victimized because they stood up for their own ideals and believes. They did not mind sacrificing their wealth, their reputation, or even their lives. They fought for what was right and did what needed to be done. Horatius and his two followers exemplified the heroic deeds of many who sought to fight for what they hold dear. They provided the original blueprint for a war hero who saved the lives of his countrymen and showed the rewards one would receive once received. This passage became a legendary tale that would inspire millions to come to fight and die for their countries and their ideals. Their tale became a well-known and widely-referenced example of sacrificing for the greater good. Thomas Babington, in his poem *Horatius at the Bridge*, he intensified the patriotic passion of Horatius and his willingness to sacrifice.

> There are more things…likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
> <p style="text-align: right">Seneca, <em>Letters from a Stoic</em></p>

The worst kind of victims, as I came to understand, were the kind that suffered for nothing. They had no voluntary will in their downfall, and their personal virtue had nothing to do with their status as innocent people. They might be unfortunate casualty of natural disasters and manmade accidents, the unwitting collateral damage of a greater historical trend, or targets of mass panic and intentional extermination. *Maus*, a comic book by Art Spiegelman, presented the story of a survivor of the Holocaust, one of the most significant genocide in human history. He chose to present Jews as mouse and Nazis as cats to highlight the intense fear experienced by the Jewish people, like a prey's natural dread of its predator. In his book, he portrayed his father, the survivor, as a more human character. Though he survived the Holocaust, he was in  no way a perfect person. Like anyone, he had a life, a family, and bribed and stole to keep himself and his family alive. He was a miser and a shrewd survivor trapped by circumstance. His wrongdoings, in no way, justified the cruel, inhumane treatment he received during his years in Auschwitz.

> History is written by the victors.
> <p style="text-align: right">Winston Churchill</p>

In his book _Anna Karenina_, Leo Tolstoy wrote these immortal lines: "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." A similar spirit should be applied to victims as well: bystanders are all alike, every victim is created in his or her own way. In my search for stories of victims, I was truly astonished by humanity's ingenuity for persecution and willingness for sacrifice as well as the resulted vast diversity of victims. Plenty of sideroads–sometimes I think too many–leads to victimization. As victims, nevertheless, they could not depend on history's fair depiction of their stories. They are, at any rate, victims and not the famed authors of history. Their stories are rarely preserved intact, often forgotten or distorted. Victors often recorded history with biases of their times, or depicted stories with a goal in mind as part of an argument. Even with more objective means of depiction, i.e. photography and film, the photographer still express authorial intent in the composition and the timing of the shots. Consequently, we, as the audience, should always beware of the biases the depictors–and us-might have used to interpret and present history.
