The music, which can be accessed [here](../src/music.mp3), was generated using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on Bach's piano fugues. RNN is a class of Long Short-term Memory network and is especially adept to use information provided based on a timed sequence. The training set was sourced from [Bach Midi Index](http://www.bachcentral.com/midiindexcomplete.html), and the Neural Network Model was built using Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) AI Library.
