    <!--Assassination of Caesar-->
    <div class="text">
        <p style="text-align: center;">"Many Cruel Past Deeds"</p>
        <p>His many cruel past deeds and abuse of power were not forgotten. For good reason, they led to his death. He
            was called Father of His Country and became Dictator for Life, meaning he had control over life and death.
            He also became Censor for Life, which gave him the power to count and tax the people under his control. He
            was the emperor and had his statue placed among the kings. He had a golden chair in the senate-house, the
            holy chariot, temples, altars, and statues among the gods. A group of priests prayed for him, like those of
            Pan, the great god of Nature. He even had the month of July named in his honor. Using his power as dictator,
            he held no meetings with the people. During the last two years he controlled the choosing of judges, who
            were allowed to serve for many years. Not following the laws that had been in place, he chose leaders that
            were not elected by the people. They were in control when he was not in Rome. Many of these had been his
            praetors or personal bodyguards. He admitted into the senate some men from Gaul, who were semi-barbarians,
            that he had defeated in the Gallic Wars. The control of the mint, for making money and collecting taxes, he
            gave to freed slaves from his own household. He left three legions of troops in Alexandria, Egypt, to be
            commanded by the son of his freed slave Rufinus.</p>

    <!--Odyssey-->
    <div class="text">
        <p>“So he spoke, and in our breasts our spirit was broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous self; yet
            even so I made answer and spoke to him, saying: `We, thou must know, are from Troy, Achaeans, driven
            wandering by all manner of winds over the great gulf of the sea. Seeking our home, we have come by another
            way, by other paths; so, I ween, Zeus was pleased to devise. And we declare that we are the men of
            Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame is now mightiest under heaven, so great a city did he sack, and slew
            many people; but we on our part, thus visiting thee, have come as suppliants to thy knees, in the hope that
            thou wilt give us entertainment, or in other wise make some present, as is the due of strangers. Nay,
            mightiest one, reverence the gods; we are thy suppliants; and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and
            strangers—Zeus, the strangers' god—who ever attends upon reverend strangers.'</p>
        <p>“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer with pitiless heart: `A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from
            afar, seeing that thou biddest me either to fear or to shun the gods. For the Cyclopes reck not of Zeus, who
            bears the aegis, nor of the blessed gods, since verily we are better far than they. Nor would I, to shun the
            wrath of Zeus, spare either thee or thy comrades, unless my own heart should bid me. But tell me where thou
            didst moor thy well-wrought ship on thy coming. Was it haply at a remote part of the land, or close by? I
            fain would know.’</p>
        <p>“So he spoke, tempting me, but he trapped me not because of my great cunning; and I made answer again in
            crafty words: `My ship Poseidon, the earth-shaker, dashed to pieces, casting her upon the rocks at the
            border of your land; for he brought her close to the headland, and the wind drove her in from the sea. But
            I, with these men here, escaped utter destruction.’</p>
        <p>“So I spoke, but from his pitiless heart he made no answer, but sprang up and put forth his hands upon my
            comrades. Two of them at once he seized and dashed to the earth like puppies, and the brain flowed forth
            upon the ground and wetted the earth. Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready his supper, and ate
            them as a mountain-nurtured lion, leaving naught—ate the entrails, and the flesh, and the marrowy bones. And
            we with wailing held up our hands to Zeus, beholding his cruel deeds; and helplessness possessed our souls.
            But when the Cyclops had filled his huge maw by eating human flesh and thereafter drinking pure milk, he lay
            down within the cave, stretched out among the sheep. And I formed a plan in my great heart to steal near
            him, and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh and smite him in the breast, where the midriff holds the
            liver, feeling for the place with my hand. But a second thought checked me, for right there should we, too,
            have perished in utter ruin. For we should not have been able to thrust back with our hands from the high
            door the mighty stone which he had set there. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright Dawn.</p>

    <!--Horatius at the Bridge-->
    <div class="text poem">
        <p style="column-count: 3">Then out spake brave Horatius,<br>
            The Captain of the gate:<br>
            “To every man upon this earth<br>
            Death cometh soon or late.<br>
            And how can man die better<br>
            Than facing fearful odds<br>
            For the ashes of his fathers<br>
            And the temples of his gods,<br>
            <br>
            “And for the tender mother<br>
            Who dandled him to rest,<br>
            And for the wife who nurses<br>
            His baby at her breast,<br>
            And for the holy maidens<br>
            Who feed the eternal flame,—<br>
            To save them from false Sextus<br>
            That wrought the deed of shame?<br>
            <br>
            “Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,<br>
            With all the speed ye may;<br>
            I, with two more to help me,<br>
            Will hold the foe in play.<br>
            In yon strait path a thousand<br>
            May well be stopped by three:<br>
            Now who will stand on either hand,<br>
            And keep the bridge with me?”<br>
            <br>
            Then out spake Spurius Lartius,—<br>
            A Ramnian proud was he:<br>
            “Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,<br>
            And keep the bridge with thee.”<br>
            And out spake strong Herminius,—<br>
            Of Titian blood was he:<br>
            “I will abide on thy left side,<br>
            And keep the bridge with thee.”<br>
            <br>
            “Horatius,” quoth the Consul,<br>
            “As thou sayest so let it be,”<br>
            And straight against that great array<br>
            Went forth the dauntless three.<br>
            For Romans in Rome’s quarrel<br>
            Spared neither land nor gold,<br>
            Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,<br>
            In the brave days of old.<br>
            <br>
            Then none was for a party—<br>
            Then all were for the state;<br>
            Then the great man helped the poor,<br>
            And the poor man loved the great;<br>
            Then lands were fairly portioned!<br>
            Then spoils were fairly sold:<br>
            The Romans were like brothers<br>
            In the brave days of old.<br>
            <br>
            Now Roman is to Roman<br>
            More hateful than a foe,<br>
            And the tribunes beard the high,<br>
            And the fathers grind the low.<br>
            As we wax hot in faction,<br>
            In battle we wax cold;<br>
            Wherefore men fight not as they fought<br>
            In the brave days of old.<br>
            <br>
            Now while the three were tightening<br>
            Their harness on their backs,<br>
            The Consul was the foremost man<br>
            To take in hand an axe;<br>
            And fathers, mixed with commons,<br>
            Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,<br>
            And smote upon the planks above,<br>
            And loosed the props below.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile the Tuscan army,<br>
            Right glorious to behold,<br>
            Came flashing back the noonday light,<br>
            Rank behind rank, like surges bright<br>
            Of a broad sea of gold.<br>
            Four hundred trumpets sounded<br>
            A peal of warlike glee,<br>
            As that great host with measured tread,<br>
            And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,<br>
            Rolled slowly toward the bridge’s head,<br>
            Where stood the dauntless three.<br>
            <br>
            The three stood calm and silent,<br>
            And looked upon the foes,<br>
            And a great shout of laughter<br>
            From all the vanguard rose;<br>
            And forth three chiefs came spurring<br>
            Before that deep array;<br>
            To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,<br>
            And lifted high their shields, and flew<br>
            To win the narrow way.<br>
            <br>
            Aunus, from green Tifernum,<br>
            Lord of the Hill of Vines;<br>
            And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves<br>
            Sicken in Ilva’s mines;<br>
            And Picus, long to Clusium<br>
            Vassal in peace and war,<br>
            Who led to fight his Umbrian powers<br>
            From that gray crag where, girt with towers,<br>
            The fortress of Nequinum lowers<br>
            O’er the pale waves of Nar.

    <!--Women's March on Versailles-->
    <div class="text">
        <p>[Several of the men having been left behind at Sevrès,] he and the women continued on their journey to
            Versailles. Past Viroflay they met a number of individuals on horseback who appeared to be bourgeois and
            wore black cockades in their hats. The women stopped them and made as if to commit violence against them,
            saying that they must die as punishment for having insulted, and for insulting, the national cockade; one
            they struck and pulled off his horse, tearing off his black cockade, which one of the women handed to him
            (the witness). He ordered the other women to halt . . . and came to the aid of the man whom they were
            ill-using; he obtained his release on condition that he should surrender his horse, that he should march
            behind them, and that at the first place they came to he should be made to carry on his back a placard
            proclaiming that he had insulted the national cockade. . . . [The same treatment having been meted out to
            two other passersby, and two of the women having mounted their horses,] he drew the women up (as far as it
            was in his power to do so) in three ranks and made them form a circle and told them that the two cannons
            that they had with them must be removed from the head of their procession; that although they had no
            ammunition, they might be suspected of evil intentions; that they would do better to give an air of gaiety
            than to occasion a riot in Versailles; and that as the city had not been warned of their proceedings, its
            inhabitants might mistake their purpose, and they might become the victims of their own zeal. They consented
            to do as he wished; consequently, the cannons were placed behind them, and he invited the women to chant
            "Long live Henry IV!" as they entered Versailles and to cry "Long live the king!"—a cry which they did not
            cease to repeat in the midst of the citizens awaiting them, who greeted them with cries of "Long live our
            Parisiennes!" So they arrived at the door of the National Assembly, where he told them that it would be
            imprudent for more than five or six of them to appear. They refused, all wanting to go in, whereupon a
            guards' officer, on duty at the National Assembly, joined him and urged that not more than twelve of the
            women should enter. . . .</p>

        <p>After much discussion among the women, fifteen were chosen to appear with him at the bar of the National
            Assembly; of these fifteen he only knew the woman Lavarenne, who has just been awarded a medal by the Paris
            city council. Entering the assembly, he urged the women to be silent and to leave to him the task of
            communicating to the assembly their demands, as they had explained them to him on the way; to this they
            consented. He then asked the president's leave to speak. M. Mounier, who was then president, granted him
            leave. . . .</p>

        <p>He (the witness) now once more addressed the assembly and said that to restore calm, allay public disquiet,
            and avert disaster, he begged the gentlemen of the assembly to appoint a deputation to go to the Life-Guards
            in order to enjoin them to adopt the national cockade and make amends for the injury they were said to have
            done to it. Several members raised their voices and said it was false that the Life-Guards had ever insulted
            the national cockade, that all who wished to be citizens could be so freely, and that no one could be forced
            to be so. Speaking again and displaying three black cockades (the same that were spoken of earlier), he said
            that, on the contrary, there should be no person who did not take pride in being so and that if there were
            within this august assembly any members that felt dishonored by this title, they should be excluded
            immediately. Many applauded these words, and the hall rang with cries of "Yes, all should be so and we are
            all citizens." In the midst of this applause he was handed a national cockade, sent in by the Life-Guards,
            which he showed to all the women as a proof of their submission, and all the women cried, "Long live the
            king and the Life-Guards!" He once more asked leave to speak and said that it was essential also, in order
            to avert misfortune and to allay the suspicions that had been spread in the capital concerning the arrival
            of the Flanders Regiment at Versailles, to withdraw this regiment, because the citizens feared it might
            start a revolution. [The assembly now agreed to appoint a deputation to wait upon the king and put forward
            the women's demands. Meanwhile, angry words were exchanged with the clerical members of the assembly, and it
            was rumored that the Life-Guards had fired on the women outside.]</p>

        <p>As he spoke, a dozen women entered the National Assembly and said that the Life-Guards had just fired on
            them, that one had been arrested, and that they were waiting for him (the witness) to come down before
            deciding on the manner of the death he had merited. At that moment the sound of musket fire could be heard;
            this caused alarm in the assembly, and he was urged by several deputies to hasten down in order to put a
            stop to these mischiefs. He went down surrounded by the women and observed a Life-Guard, who was being held
            by the bridle of his horse; the man wished to dismount, but the women prevented him, though without doing
            him any injury other than to hurl abuse at him. When the Life-Guard saw him advance to speak to him, he drew
            a sword and cut through his reins; the point of the sword struck a woman on the shoulder, and he fled. He
            (the witness) made to run after him, but he could not catch him, and the Life-Guard, as he fled, discharged
            his pistol at him but failed to hit him. He (the witness) then returned to the National Assembly, having
            enjoined the women not to approach closer to the royal palace. At eight o'clock in the evening the president
            returned with his deputation from their audience with the king. He repeated the king's words before the
            assembly; the women listened respectfully, as their intent was to restore calm among his people. Then the
            president read aloud five papers relative to the demands addressed by the Parisian National Guard to the
            National Assembly and to the king concerning the food supply. His Majesty had commanded that two officers
            should accompany him (the witness) back to Paris, but the women objected to this, and all said that they
            alone should escort him. . . .</p>

        <p>Arriving in Paris, he gave orders to be taken directly to the City Hall, which he entered escorted by some
            150 women, who went ahead of him into the hall where sat the representatives of the commune, the mayor
            presiding. He (the witness) gave an account of all that had taken place. . . . At six o'clock in the morning
            of Tuesday, 6 October, the mayor besought the women to withdraw to their homes, which they did; but eight or
            ten of them escorted him (the witness) to his dwelling, which was then the Hôtel de Grenelle St. Honoré in
            the street of the same name. At eight o'clock in the morning of this same day, ten to twelve women came to
            fetch him and compelled him to march with them to meet the National Guard and present the Marquis de
            Lafayette with a laurel branch on his return from Versailles. But a messenger whom they encountered told
            them that he was ordered to have the Tuileries palace prepared to receive His Majesty, who was coming to
            Paris that evening. The women urged him (the witness) to go with them to meet His Majesty. So he went with
            them, and they met the king at Viroflay. They mingled with the women who escorted the king's carriage and
            returned to Paris to the City Hall, and here he left all these women. And that is all he knew of the
            matter.</p>

    <!--Galileo and the Roman Inquisition-->
    <div class="text">
        <p>Whereas you, Galileo, son of the late Vincenzio Galilei, of Florence, aged seventy years, were denounced in
            1615, to this Holy Office, for holding as true a false doctrine taught by many, namely, that the sun is
            immovable in the center of the world, and that the earth moves, and also with a diurnal motion; also, for
            having pupils whom you instructed in the same opinions; also, for maintaining a correspondence on the same
            with some German mathematicians; also for publishing certain letters on the sun-spots, in which you
            developed the same doctrine as true; also, for answering the objections which were continually produced from
            the Holy Scriptures, by glozing the said Scriptures according to your own meaning; and whereas thereupon was
            produced the copy of a writing, in form of a letter professedly written by you to a person formerly your
            pupil, in which, following the hypothesis of Copernicus, you include several propositions contrary to the
            true sense and authority of the Holy Scriptures; therefore (this Holy Tribunal being desirous of providing
            against the disorder and mischief which were thence proceeding and increasing to the detriment of the Holy
            Faith) by the desire of his Holiness and the Most Emminent Lords, Cardinals of this supreme and universal
            Inquisition, the two propositions of the stability of the sun, and the motion of the earth, were qualified
            by the Theological Qualifiers as follows: 1. The proposition that the sun is in the center of the world and
            immovable from its place is absurd, philosophically false, and formally heretical; because it is expressly
            contrary to Holy Scriptures. 2. The proposition that the earth is not the center of the world, nor
            immovable, but that it moves, and also with a diurnal action, is also absurd, philosophically false, and,
            theologically considered, at least erroneous in faith. Therefore . . . , invoking the most holy name of our
            Lord Jesus Christ and of His Most Glorious Mother Mary, We pronounce this Our final sentence: We pronounce,
            judge, and declare, that you, the said Galileo . . . have rendered yourself vehemently suspected by this
            Holy Office of heresy, that is, of having believed and held the doctrine (which is false and contrary to the
            Holy and Divine Scriptures) that the sun is the center of the world, and that it does not move from east to
            west, and that the earth does move, and is not the center of the world; also, that an opinion can be held
            and supported as probable, after it has been declared and finally decreed contrary to the Holy Scripture,
            and, consequently, that you have incurred all the censures and penalties enjoined and promulgated in the
            sacred canons and other general and particular constituents against delinquents of this description. From
            which it is Our pleasure that you be absolved, provided that with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, in
            Our presence, you abjure, curse, and detest, the said error and heresies, and every other error and heresy
            contrary to the Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome. 1633 A.D.</p>

    <!--Cleon Debate-->
    <div class="text">
        <p>27. In the meantime the Mitylenians, finding their provisions failing, while the fleet from Peloponnese was
            loitering on the way instead of appearing at Mitylene, were compelled to come to terms with the Athenians in
            the following manner. Salaethus having himself ceased to expect the fleet to arrive, now armed the commons
            with heavy armour, which they had not before possessed, with the intention of making a sortie against the
            Athenians. The commons, however, no sooner found themselves possessed of arms than they refused any longer
            to obey their officers; and forming in knots together, told the authorities to bring out in public the
            provisions and divide them amongst them all, or they would themselves come to terms with the Athenians and
            deliver up the city.</p>
        <p>28. The government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of the danger they would be in, if left out
            of the capitulation, publicly agreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion and to
            admit the troops into the town; upon the understanding that the Mitylenians should be allowed to send an
            embassy to Athens to plead their cause, and that Paches should not imprison, make slaves of, or put to death
            any of the citizens until its return. Such were the terms of the capitulation; in spite of which the chief
            authors of the negotiation with Lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when the army entered that
            they went and seated themselves by the altars, from which they were raised up by Paches under promise that
            he would do them no wrong, and lodged by him in Tenedos, until he should learn the pleasure of the Athenians
            concerning them. Paches also sent some galleys and seized Antissa, and took such other military measures as
            he thought advisable.
        </p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>36. Upon the arrival of the prisoners with Salaethus, the Athenians at once put the latter to death, although
            he offered, among other things, to procure the withdrawal of the Peloponnesians from Plataea, which was
            still under siege; and after deliberating as to what they should do with the former, in the fury of the
            moment determined to put to death not only the prisoners at Athens, but the whole adult male population of
            Mitylene, and to make slaves of the women and children. It was remarked that Mitylene had revolted without
            being, like the rest, subjected to the empire; and what above all swelled the wrath of the Athenians was the
            fact of the Peloponnesian fleet having ventured over to Ionia to her support, a fact which was held to argue
            a long meditated rebellion. They accordingly sent a galley to communicate the decree to Paches, commanding
            him to lose no time in dispatching the Mitylenians. The morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on
            the horrid cruelty of a decree, which condemned a whole city to the fate merited only by the guilty. This
            was no sooner perceived by the Mitylenian ambassadors at Athens and their Athenian supporters, than they
            moved the authorities to put the question again to the vote; which they the more easily consented to do, as
            they themselves plainly saw that most of the citizens wished some one to give them an opportunity for
            reconsidering the matter. An assembly was therefore at once called, and after much expression of opinion
            upon both sides, Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, the same who had carried the former motion of putting the
            Mitylenians to death, the most violent man at Athens, and at that time by far the most powerful with the
            commons, came forward again and spoke as follows:</p>
        <p>40. "No hope, therefore, that rhetoric may instil or money purchase, of the mercy due to human infirmity must
            be held out to the Mitylenians. Their offence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy
            is only for unwilling offenders. I therefore, now as before, persist against your reversing your first
            decision, or giving way to the three failings most fatal to empire—pity, sentiment, and indulgence.
            Compassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to those who will never pity us in return,
            but are our natural and necessary foes: the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other less
            important arenas for their talents, in the place of one where the city pays a heavy penalty for a momentary
            pleasure, themselves receiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases; while indulgence should be shown
            towards those who will be our friends in future, instead of towards men who will remain just what they were,
            and as much our enemies as before. To sum up shortly, I say that if you follow my advice you will do what is
            just towards the Mitylenians, and at the same time expedient; while by a different decision you will not
            oblige them so much as pass sentence upon yourselves. For if they were right in rebelling, you must be wrong
            in ruling. However, if, right or wrong, you determine to rule, you must carry out your principle and punish
            the Mitylenians as your interest requires; or else you must give up your empire and cultivate honesty
            without danger. Make up your minds, therefore, to give them like for like; and do not let the victims who
            escaped the plot be more insensible than the conspirators who hatched it; but reflect what they would have
            done if victorious over you, especially they were the aggressors. It is they who wrong their neighbour
            without a cause, that pursue their victim to the death, on account of the danger which they foresee in
            letting their enemy survive; since the object of a wanton wrong is more dangerous, if he escape, than an
            enemy who has not this to complain of. Do not, therefore, be traitors to yourselves, but recall as nearly as
            possible the moment of suffering and the supreme importance which you then attached to their reduction; and
            now pay them back in their turn, without yielding to present weakness or forgetting the peril that once hung
            over you. Punish them as they deserve, and teach your other allies by a striking example that the penalty of
            rebellion is death. Let them once understand this and you will not have so often to neglect your enemies
            while you are fighting with your own confederates."</p>
        <p>49. Such were the words of Diodotus. The two opinions thus expressed were the ones that most directly
            contradicted each other; and the Athenians, notwithstanding their change of feeling, now proceeded to a
            division, in which the show of hands was almost equal, although the motion of Diodotus carried the day.
            Another galley was at once sent off in haste, for fear that the first might reach Lesbos in the interval,
            and the city be found destroyed; the first ship having about a day and a night's start. Wine and
            barley-cakes were provided for the vessel by the Mitylenian ambassadors, and great promises made if they
            arrived in time; which caused the men to use such diligence upon the voyage that they took their meals of
            barley-cakes kneaded with oil and wine as they rowed, and only slept by turns while the others were at the
            oar. Luckily they met with no contrary wind, and the first ship making no haste upon so horrid an errand,
            while the second pressed on in the manner described, the first arrived so little before them, that Paches
            had only just had time to read the decree, and to prepare to execute the sentence, when the second put into
            port and prevented the massacre. The danger of Mitylene had indeed been great.</p>
        <p>50. The other party whom Paches had sent off as the prime movers in the rebellion, were upon Cleon's motion
            put to death by the Athenians, the number being rather more than a thousand. The Athenians also demolished
            the walls of the Mitylenians, and took possession of their ships. Afterwards tribute was not imposed upon
            the Lesbians; but all their land, except that of the Methymnians, was divided into three thousand
            allotments, three hundred of which were reserved as sacred for the gods, and the rest assigned by lot to
            Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to the island. With these the Lesbians agreed to pay a rent of two
            minae a year for each allotment, and cultivated the land themselves. The Athenians also took possession of
            the towns on the continent belonging to the Mitylenians, which thus became for the future subject to Athens.
            Such were the events that took place at Lesbos.

                By rage of evil and by snares of death.<br>
                Fronting the fierceness of the elements,<br>
                Sharing our ills, indulge me my lament.<br>
                'T is pride," ye say—"the pride of rebel heart,<br>
                To think we might fare better than we do."<br>
                Go, tell it to the Tagus' stricken banks;<br>
                Search in the ruins of that bloody shock;<br>
                Ask of the dying in that house of grief.<br>
                Whether 't is pride that calls on heaven for help<br>
                And pity for the sufferings of men.<br>
                "All's well," ye say, "and all is necessary,"<br>
                Think ye this universe had been the worse<br>
                Without this hellish gulf in Portugal?<br>
                Are ye so sure the great eternal cause,<br>
                That knows all things, and for itself creates,<br>
                Could not have placed us in this dreary clime<br>
                Without volcanoes seething 'neath our feet?<br>
                Set you this limit to the power supreme?<br>
                Would you forbid it use its clemency?<br>
                Are not the means of the great artisan<br>
                Unlimited for shaping his designs?<br>
                The master I would not offend, yet wish<br>
                This gulf of fire and sulphur had outpoured<br>
                Its baleful flood amid the desert wastes.<br>
                God I respect, yet love the universe.</p>

            <p>Not pride, alas, it is, but love of man,<br>
                To mourn so terrible a stroke as this.<br>
                <br>
                Would it console the sad inhabitants<br>
                Of these aflame and desolated shores<br>
                To say to them: "Lay down your lives in peace;<br>
                For the world's good your homes are sacrificed;<br>
                Your ruined palaces shall others build,<br>
                For other peoples shall your walls arise;<br>
                The North grows rich on your unhappy loss;<br>
                Your ills are but a link in general law;<br>
                To God you are as those low creeping worms<br>
                That wait for you in your predestined tombs"?<br>
                What speech to hold to victims of such ruth!<br>
                Add not such cruel outrage to their pain.<br>
                <br>
                Nay, press not on my agitated heart<br>
                These iron and irrevocable laws,<br>
                This rigid chain of bodies, minds, and worlds.<br>
                Dreams of the bloodless thinker are such thoughts.<br>
                God holds the chain: is not himself enchained;<br>
                By his indulgent choice is all arranged;<br>
                Implacable he's not, but free and just.<br>
                Why suffer we, then, under one so just?<br>
                There is the knot your thinkers should undo.<br>
                Think ye to cure our ills denying them?<br>
                All peoples, trembling at the hand of God,<br>
                Have sought the source of evil in the world.<br>
                When the eternal law that all things moves<br>
                Doth hurl the rock by impact of the winds,</p>

            <p>With, lightning rends and fires the sturdy oak,<br>
                They have no feeling of the crashing blows;<br>
                But I, I live and feel, my wounded heart<br>
                Appeals for aid to him who fashioned it.<br>
                <br>
                Children of that Almighty Power, we stretch<br>
                Our hands in grief towards our common sire.<br>
                The vessel, truly, is not heard to say:<br>
                "Why should I be so vile, so coarse, so frail?"<br>
                Nor speech nor thought is given unto it.<br>
                The urn that, from the potter's forming hand,<br>
                Slips and is shattered has no living heart<br>
                That yearns for bliss and shrinks from misery.<br>
                "This misery," ye say, "is others' good."<br>
                Yes; from my mouldering body shall be born<br>
                A thousand worms, when death has closed my pain.<br>
                Fine consolation this in my distress!<br>
                Grim speculators on the woes of men,<br>
                Ye double, not assuage, my misery.<br>
                In you I mark the nerveless boast of pride<br>
                That hides its ill with pretext of content.<br>
                <br>
                I am a puny part of the great whole.<br>
                Yes; but all animals condemned to live,<br>
                All sentient things, born by the same stern law,<br>
                Suffer like me, and like me also die.<br>
                <br>
                The vulture fastens on his timid prey,<br>
                And stabs with bloody beak the quivering limbs:<br>
                All's well, it seems, for it. But in a while<br>
                An eagle tears the vulture into shreds;</p>

            <p>The eagle is transfixed by shaft of man;<br>
                The man, prone in the dust of battlefield,<br>
                Mingling his blood with dying fellow-men,<br>
                Becomes in turn the food of ravenous birds.<br>
                Thus the whole world in every member groans:<br>
                All born for torment and for mutual death.<br>
                And o'er this ghastly chaos you would say<br>
                The ills of each make up the good of all!<br>
                What blessedness! And as, with quaking voice,<br>
                Mortal and pitiful, ye cry, "All's well,"<br>
                The universe belies you, and your heart<br>
                Refutes a hundred times your mind's conceit.<br>
                <br>
                All dead and living things are locked in strife.<br>
                Confess it freely—evil stalks the land,<br>
                Its secret principle unknown to us.<br>
                Can it be from the author of all good?<br>
                Are we condemned to weep by tyrant law<br>
                Of black Typhon or barbarous Ahriman?<br>
                These odious monsters, whom a trembling world<br>
                Made gods, my spirit utterly rejects.<br>
                <br>
                But how conceive a God supremely good,<br>
                Who heaps his favours on the sons he loves,<br>
                Yet scatters evil with as large a hand?<br>
                What eye can pierce the depth of his designs?<br>
                From that all-perfect Being came not ill:<br>
                And came it from no other, for he's lord:<br>
                Yet it exists. O stern and numbing truth!</p>

            <p>O wondrous mingling of diversities!<br>
                A God came down to lift our stricken race:<br>
                He visited the earth, and changed it not!<br>
                One sophist says he had not power to change;<br>
                "He had," another cries, "but willed it not:<br>
                In time he will, no doubt." And, while they prate,<br>
                The hidden thunders, belched from underground,<br>
                Fling wide the ruins of a hundred towns<br>
                Across the smiling face of Portugal.<br>
                God either smites the inborn guilt of man,<br>
                Or, arbitrary lord of space and time,<br>
                Devoid alike of pity and of wrath,<br>
                Pursues the cold designs he has conceived.<br>
                Or else this formless stuff, recalcitrant,<br>
                Bears in itself inalienable faults;<br>
                Or else God tries us, and this mortal life<br>
                Is but the passage to eternal spheres.<br>
                'T is transitory pain we suffer here,<br>
                And death its merciful deliverance.<br>
                Yet, when this dreadful passage has been made,<br>
                Who will contend he has deserved the crown?<br>
                Whatever side we take we needs must groan;<br>
                We nothing know, and everything must fear.<br>
                Nature is dumb, in vain appeal to it;<br>
                The human race demands a word of God.<br>
                'T is his alone to illustrate his work,<br>
                Console the weary, and illume the wise.<br>
                Without him man, to doubt and error doomed,<br>
                Finds not a reed that he may lean upon.<br>
                From Leibnitz learn we not by what unseen<br>
                Bonds, in this best of all imagined worlds,<br>
                Endless disorder, chaos of distress,<br>
                Must mix our little pleasures thus with pain;</p>


            <p>Nor why the guiltless suffer all this woe<br>
                In common with the most abhorrent guilt.<br>
                'T is mockery to tell me all is well.<br>
                Like learned doctors, nothing do I know.<br>
                Plato has said that men did once have wings<br>
                And bodies proof against all mortal ill;<br>
                That pain and death were strangers to their world.<br>
                How have we fallen from that high estate!<br>
                Man crawls and dies: all is but born to die:<br>
                The world's the empire of destructiveness.<br>
                This frail construction of quick nerves and bones<br>
                Cannot sustain the shock of elements;<br>
                This temporary blend of blood and dust<br>
                Was put together only to dissolve;<br>
                This prompt and vivid sentiment of nerve<br>
                Was made for pain, the minister of death:<br>
                Thus in my ear does nature's message run.<br>
                With even poised scale Bayle bids me doubt.<br>
                He, wise and great enough to need no creed,<br>
                Has slain all systems—combats even himself:<br>
                Like that blind conqueror of Philistines,<br>
                He sinks beneath the ruin he has wrought.<br>
                What is the verdict of the vastest mind?<br>
                Silence: the book of fate is closed to us.</p>


            <p>Man is a stranger to his own research;<br>
                He knows not whence he comes, nor whither goes.<br>
                Tormented atoms in a bed of mud,<br>
                Devoured by death, a mockery of fate.<br>
                But thinking atoms, whose far-seeing eyes,<br>
                Guided by thought, have measured the faint stars,<br>
                Our being mingles with the infinite;<br>
                Ourselves we never see, or come to know.<br>
                This world, this theatre of pride and wrong,<br>
                Swarms with sick fools who talk of happiness.<br>
                With plaints and groans they follow up the quest,<br>
                To die reluctant, or be born again.<br>
                At fitful moments in our pain-racked life<br>
                The hand of pleasure wipes away our tears;<br>
                But pleasure passes like a fleeting shade,<br>
                And leaves a legacy of pain and loss.<br>
                The past for us is but a fond regret,<br>
                The present grim, unless the future's clear.<br>
                If thought must end in darkness of the tomb,<br>
                All will be well one day—so runs our hope.<br>
                All <i>now</i> is well, is but an idle dream.<br>
                The wise deceive me: God alone is right.<br>
                With lowly sighing, subject in my pain,<br>
                I do not fling myself 'gainst Providence.<br>
                Once did I sing, in less lugubrious tone,<br>
                The sunny ways of pleasure's genial rule;<br>
                The times have changed, and, taught by growing age,<br>
                And sharing of the frailty of mankind,<br>
                Seeking a light amid the deepening gloom,<br>
                I can but suffer, and will not repine.<br>
                <br>
                A caliph once, when his last hour had come,<br>
                This prayer addressed to him he reverenced:</p>

            <p>"To thee, sole and all-powerful king, I bear<br>
                What thou dost lack in thy immensity—<br>
                Evil and ignorance, distress and sin."<br>
                He might have added one thing further—hope.</p>
